- Spring Security
- Thymeleaf (template engine)

**Frontend Enhancement:**
- HTMX (partial page updates)
- Alpine.js (lightweight interactivity)
- Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL 17

**Document Storage:**
- Phase 1: MinIO (self-hosted, S3-compatible)
- Phase 2+: Indonesian cloud (Biznet Gio, IDCloudHost) or AWS S3/GCS

### Development & Testing

**Local Development:**
- Docker Compose (multi-container orchestration)

**Infrastructure:**
- Current: Docker Compose + manual provisioning
- Future: Pulumi (programmatic VPS provisioning for SaaS)

**Testing:**
- JUnit 5 + Mockito (unit tests)
- Testcontainers (integration tests)
- Playwright (functional/E2E tests)
- K6 (performance testing)

**DevSecOps:**
- SonarQube (SAST)
- OWASP Dependency-Check (dependency vulnerabilities)
- OWASP ZAP (DAST)
- Trivy (container security)
- GitLeaks (secret scanning)

### Architecture: Modern Monolith

**Why not split Backend/Frontend?**
- Single codebase reduces complexity
- No data model or validation duplication
- Simple session-based authentication
- Faster development for accounting workflows
- HTMX provides modern UX without SPA overhead

See [Technology Stack Documentation](docs/05-technology-stack.md) for detailed justification and DevSecOps pipeline.
