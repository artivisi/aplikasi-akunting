# Decisions & Open Questions

## Decisions Made

### 1. Transaction-Centric Architecture ✓
**Decision:** Use transaction forms with journal templates instead of direct account-based entry

**Rationale:**
- Target users have minimal accounting knowledge
- Reduces data entry errors
- Maintains proper double-entry bookkeeping behind the scenes
- More intuitive for business owners

**Trade-offs:**
- More complex implementation
- Need to build template system
- Less direct control for power users (mitigated by manual journal entry option)

### 2. Journal Template Approach ✓
**Decision:** Implement configurable journal templates with preloaded defaults and power-user customization

**Rationale:**
- Flexibility for different business scenarios
- No code changes needed for new transaction types
- Users can adapt to their specific needs
- Handles simple to complex entries (one-to-many, many-to-many)

**Trade-offs:**
- More database complexity
- Template builder UI required for power users
- Template validation logic needed

### 3. Single-Tenant Architecture ✓
**Decision:** Instance-per-client deployment (not multi-tenant with tenant_id)

**Rationale:**
- Simpler codebase (no tenant_id in every query)
- Complete data and process isolation
- No risk of cross-tenant data leaks
- Easier compliance for accounting data
- Can co-locate multiple instances for cost efficiency
- Can isolate high-value clients on dedicated VPS

**Deployment Progression:**
1. **Phase 1 (MVP):** Single company, manual deployment, Docker Compose
2. **Phase 2 (Early SaaS):** Multi-instance single node, control plane for client management, 5-50 clients
3. **Phase 3 (Growth):** Node per client, Pulumi automation, 50+ clients with premium tiers

**Trade-offs:**
- Need control plane app for SaaS automation (Phase 2+)
- More containers/processes to manage
- Acceptable: Focus on product stability first (Phase 1), automate incrementally
- More testing scenarios

- Limited to simple buy/sell model

### 32. Project Tracking vs Cost Centers ✓
**Decision:** Simple project tracking for Phase 1, defer generic tags to Phase 2. No traditional cost centers.

**Date:** 2025-11-24

**Rationale:**
- Target market (IT Services, Photographers) works project-based, not department-based
- Traditional cost/revenue centers are for larger organizations with departments
- Projects are the natural unit of profitability analysis for service businesses
- Generic tags provide flexibility for additional dimensions (client, channel) in Phase 2

**Analysis by Segment:**
| Segment | Projects Useful? | Cost Centers Useful? |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| IT Services | ✅ High (per-project profitability) | ❌ No departments |
| Photographers | ✅ High (per-event profitability) | ❌ No departments |
| Online Sellers | ⚠️ Low (product-based, not project-based) | ❌ No departments |

**Implementation:**
- **Phase 1:** Project entity with profitability report
- **Phase 2:** Transaction tags for additional dimensions (client, channel, category)

**Trade-offs:**
- Online sellers don't benefit from project tracking (use tags for channels instead)
- No overhead allocation to projects (too complex for MVP)
- Worth it: High value for primary target segments

**Implementation Notes:**
- User creates schedule manually (no auto-detection from transactions)
- Toggle for auto-post vs draft (user chooses during creation)
- Monthly batch job generates journal entries
- Last period absorbs rounding difference
- Schedule tracks progress (completed_periods, remaining_amount)

**Trade-offs:**
- Additional module to implement
- Users must set up schedules manually
- Worth it: Significantly reduces period-end workload

### 22. Bank Reconciliation ✓
**Decision:** Yes - Manual upload with bank-specific CSV parsers

**Date:** 2025-11-22

**Rationale:**
- Valuable for catching missing/duplicate entries
- No automatic bank feed needed - users download CSV from bank app
- Most target users have accounts at major Indonesian banks
- Critical for maintaining accurate cash records

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Bank Statement Parsers (Phase 1):**
  - **CSV/Excel only** - no PDF support (PDF extraction unreliable, ~68% accuracy)
  - Preload configs for: BCA, BNI, BSI, CIMB Niaga
  - Generic CSV (user maps columns via UI)
  - Add more banks based on user demand
  - Credit card statements: use CSV export from internet banking

- **Parser Design:**
  - Single `ConfigurableBankStatementParser` class (not per-bank classes)
  - Bank configurations stored in database (not YAML)
  - Column name matching with index fallback:
    ```
    BankParserConfig:
      - bank_code: "bca"
      - bank_name: "Bank Central Asia"
      - date_columns: ["Tanggal", "Date", "Tgl"]
      - date_format: "dd/MM/yyyy"
      - description_columns: ["Keterangan", "Description"]
      - debit_columns: ["Debit", "Mutasi Debit"]
      - credit_columns: ["Credit", "Mutasi Kredit"]
      - balance_columns: ["Saldo", "Balance"]
      - decimal_separator: ","
      - thousand_separator: "."
      - skip_header_rows: 1
      - fallback_indices: {date: 0, desc: 1, debit: 2, credit: 3, balance: 4}
    ```
  - Parsing logic: match column name first → fallback to index → error if not found
  - Preload common bank configs (BCA, BNI, BSI, CIMB) during setup
  - Admin can add/edit bank configs via UI without code changes

- **Reconciliation Workflow:**
  1. User downloads CSV/Excel from bank app/website
  2. Upload to app, select bank (or auto-detect)
  3. Parser extracts: date, description, amount, balance
  4. System matches against recorded transactions (by date + amount)
  5. Show matched, unmatched (in bank only), unmatched (in books only)
  6. User reviews and creates missing entries or marks as reconciled

- **Matching Logic:**
  - Exact match: same date + same amount
  - Fuzzy match: ±1 day + same amount (for timing differences)
  - Manual match: user links transactions manually

- **Reconciliation Report:**
  - Opening balance
  - Matched transactions
  - Unreconciled items (both sides)
  - Closing balance
  - Reconciliation status per period

**Trade-offs:**
- Must update bank config if CSV format changes (database update, no code change)
- No real-time sync (manual upload required)
- Acceptable: Users already download statements for their records

- Basic tracking needed for proper accounting
- Auto-depreciation achievable without complex asset module
- Reuse existing journal template infrastructure

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Asset Register:**
  - Asset master data: name, category, purchase date, cost, useful life, depreciation method
  - Track status: Active, Disposed, Fully Depreciated
  - Calculate monthly depreciation amount

- **Auto-Journaling via Templates + Scheduler:**
  - Create depreciation journal templates per asset category
  - Scheduled batch job (monthly) generates depreciation entries:
    1. Query active assets not fully depreciated
    2. Calculate depreciation for period
    3. Generate journal entry using template
    4. Post automatically or queue for review
  - Reuses existing template system - no separate depreciation engine

- **Depreciation Methods:**
  - Straight-line (Garis Lurus): `(Cost - Residual) / Useful Life`
  - Declining balance (Saldo Menurun): `Book Value × Rate`

- **Asset Disposal:**
  - Record sale/write-off via transaction
  - Calculate gain/loss on disposal

**Trade-offs:**
- Not full-featured asset management (no revaluation, complex scenarios)
- Sufficient for target market needs

**Rationale:**
- Target market (photographers, online sellers, most IT consultants) primarily use IDR accounts
- Foreign expenses paid via IDR card/bank = bank handles conversion, no FX exposure
- Multi-currency only needed when holding foreign currency accounts or invoicing in foreign currency with time gap
- Simplifies Phase 1 implementation significantly

**When Multi-Currency is NOT Needed:**
- Pay foreign services (AWS, etc.) via IDR credit card/bank
- Receive foreign payments via PayPal with auto-convert to IDR
- All bank accounts are in IDR

**When Multi-Currency IS Needed (Phase 2):**
- Own USD/foreign currency bank account
- Invoice in USD with payment received later to USD account
- Foreign supplier with credit terms paid in foreign currency

**Implementation Notes:**
- Phase 1: All transactions in IDR, no currency field needed
- Phase 2: Add multi-currency with Option C (auto-fetch Kurs Pajak from Kemenkeu)
- BI API available for market rates, Kemenkeu scraper for Kurs Pajak

**Trade-offs:**
- IT consultants with foreign clients/USD accounts not supported in Phase 1
- Acceptable: Small subset of target market, can be added later

---

### 17. Transaction Numbering ✓
**Decision:** Per transaction type with yearly reset - `{TYPE}-{YYYY}-{seq}`

**Date:** 2025-11-22

**Rationale:**
- Easier on user's eye - can identify transaction type from number
- Organized categorization for audit and reporting
- Yearly reset keeps numbers manageable

**Implementation Notes:**
- Format: `{TYPE}-{YYYY}-{seq}` (e.g., SAL-2025-00001, EXP-2025-00001)
- Separate sequence per transaction type:
  - SAL: Sales / Penjualan
  - PUR: Purchase / Pembelian
  - EXP: Expense / Biaya
  - RCV: Receipt / Penerimaan
  - PAY: Payment / Pembayaran
  - JNL: General Journal / Jurnal Umum
  - ADJ: Adjustment / Penyesuaian
- Sequence resets to 00001 each fiscal year
- Sequence width configurable (default 5 digits)
- Faktur Pajak numbering follows DJP rules (separate system)

**Trade-offs:**
- Multiple sequences to manage
- Must handle backdating within same year correctly
- Worth it: Better UX and organization

---

### 16. Fiscal Period Locking ✓
**Decision:** Lock after tax filing, soft lock after month close (Option D)

**Date:** 2025-11-22

**Rationale:**
- Implement from the start to avoid migration headaches later
- Balances data integrity with practical correction needs
- Aligns with tax compliance requirements
- Prevents accidental modification of filed tax periods

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Month close (soft lock):**
  - Warning displayed when editing closed period
  - Requires elevated permission (admin/owner role)
  - Audit trail logged for any modifications
  - Recommended: use reversal entries instead of direct edits
- **Tax filing (hard lock):**
  - No edits allowed to periods with filed SPT
  - Must use reversal/adjustment entries in current period
  - SPT filing date recorded per tax type (PPN, PPh 21, PPh 23, etc.)
  - If correction needed: file SPT Pembetulan first, then unlock
- Period status: Open → Month Closed → Tax Filed
- UI should clearly indicate period lock status

**Trade-offs:**
- More complex period management
- Users must understand reversal entry workflow
- Worth it: Prevents tax compliance issues down the line

---

### 15. Payroll Integration ✓
**Decision:** Full payroll with salary component templates (Option C)

**Date:** 2025-11-22

**Rationale:**
- High value-add for target users without accounting/finance/tax background
- PPh 21 and BPJS calculations are too complex for IT consultants, photographers, online sellers
- Differentiator from generic accounting apps
- Reduces errors in tax withholding calculations

**Implementation Notes:**
- Salary component templates:
  - Gaji Pokok
  - Tunjangan (transport, makan, komunikasi, etc.)
  - BPJS Kesehatan (auto-calculate 4% company + 1% employee)
  - BPJS Ketenagakerjaan (JKK, JKM, JHT, JP with configurable rates)
  - PPh 21 (auto-calculate with progressive rates + PTKP)
- Employee master data: PTKP status (TK/0, K/0, K/1, K/2, K/3), NPWP
- Generate payslips
- Auto-generate journal entries for:
  - Salary expense
  - BPJS payable (company + employee portions)
  - PPh 21 payable
  - Net salary payable
- Configurable salary structures per employee or employee group
- **Onboarding simplification:**
  - Preload salary component templates during instance setup
  - Pregenerate salary configs for common job positions per industry:
    - IT Services: Developer, Designer, Project Manager, Admin
    - Photography: Photographer, Videographer, Editor, Assistant
    - Online Seller: Warehouse staff, Packer, Customer service
  - Users can use defaults immediately, customize later if needed
  - No salary configuration required during onboarding

**Trade-offs:**
- Significant implementation effort
- Must keep up with tax regulation changes (PPh 21 rates, PTKP, UMR)
- Employee data management adds complexity
- Worth it: Core value proposition for target market

---

### 14. Conditional Template Logic ✓
**Decision:** No conditional logic - keep templates simple (Option A)

**Date:** 2025-11-22

**Rationale:**
- Simpler implementation, predictable behavior
- Easier to debug when journal entries are incorrect
- Users explicitly choose the correct template for their scenario
- Avoids "magic" behavior that may confuse users

**Implementation Notes:**
- Create separate templates for different scenarios (e.g., "Penjualan Jasa", "Penjualan Jasa + PPh 23")
- Provide **preview/simulation functionality** so users can:
  - See what inputs a template requires
  - Preview generated journal entries before committing
  - Verify debit/credit balance before saving
- Template selector should guide users to correct template based on transaction characteristics

**Trade-offs:**
- More templates to manage
- User must select correct template (mitigated by preview feature)
- May revisit Option B in future if template proliferation becomes unmanageable

---

### 13. Formula Complexity ✓
**Decision:** Full expression language using SpEL with SimpleEvaluationContext (Option D)

**Date:** 2025-11-22

**Rationale:**
- SpEL is built-in to Spring - no additional dependencies
- SimpleEvaluationContext provides secure sandbox for untrusted input
- Blocks dangerous operations: type references, constructors, bean references, arbitrary method calls
- Supports all required operations: arithmetic, comparison, logical, ternary conditionals, property access
- Long-term support guaranteed by Spring team
- Familiar syntax for Java developers

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use `SimpleEvaluationContext.forReadOnlyDataBinding()` for formula evaluation
- Create `FormulaContext` root object with transaction data (amount, rate, etc.)
- Register custom functions via `setVariable()` if needed for complex scenarios
- Example formulas:
  - `amount * 0.11` (simple percentage)
  - `amount > 2000000 ? amount * 0.02 : 0` (conditional - PPh 23 threshold)
  - `transaction.amount * rate.ppn` (field references)

**Trade-offs:**
- Slightly more complex than simple percentage parsing
- Need to validate formula syntax before saving templates
- Formula errors surface at runtime (mitigate with validation on template save)

---

### 12. Template Categories/Tags ✓
**Decision:** Category + tags with favorites, frequently used, and search (Option D extended)

**Date:** 2025-11-22

**Rationale:**
- Category provides primary structure for navigation
- Tags enable flexible cross-categorization
- Favorites for quick access to preferred templates
- Frequently used for automatic surfacing of common templates
- Search for direct lookup when user knows what they want

**Implementation Notes:**
- Each template has one category (required) and multiple tags (optional)
- User-specific favorites list (stored per user)
- Track usage count per template per user for "frequently used" ranking
- Full-text search on template name, description, and tags
- UI: Show favorites first → frequently used → then by category

**Trade-offs:**
- More complex UI (multiple access patterns)
- Additional tracking for usage statistics
- User preferences storage needed

### 11. Template Validation Rules ✓
**Decision:** No runtime validation - show all templates (Option C)

**Date:** 2025-11-22

**Rationale:**
- Single-tenant architecture: each database instance is company-specific
- Templates will be pre-generated during SaaS onboarding based on company setup (PKP status, business type, etc.)
- No need for runtime validation since templates are already tailored per instance
- Simpler implementation, no conditional logic needed

**Implementation Notes:**
- SaaS control plane handles template seeding during instance provisioning
- Template set determined by company configuration at setup time
- Users can add/customize templates post-setup as needed

**Trade-offs:**
- Relies on correct setup during onboarding
- Manual template management if company status changes (e.g., becomes PKP)

---

### 10. Template Versioning ✓
**Decision:** Version templates - each edit creates new version, old transactions link to old version (Option A)

**Date:** 2025-11-22

**Rationale:**
- Required for audit traceability
- Historical accuracy of what template was used at transaction time
- Compliance requirement for accounting records

**Implementation Notes:**
- Each template edit creates a new version record
- Journal entries store reference to specific template version used
- Include traceability key in journal posting for backtracking to the originating template
- Template version history viewable for audit purposes

**Trade-offs:**
- Additional database complexity (version table, foreign keys)
- UI needed to show version history
- Migration strategy for template updates

### 9. Technology Stack: Spring Boot Monolith ✓
**Decision:** Java 25 + Spring Boot 4.0 + Thymeleaf + HTMX + Alpine.js + PostgreSQL 17

**Date:** 2025-11-19

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Spring Boot + React/Vue (Split BE/FE)
2. ExpressJS + Handlebars (Node.js)
3. Spring Boot + Thymeleaf + HTMX (Selected)

**Rationale:**
- **Monolith over Split BE/FE:**
  - Single codebase reduces maintenance overhead
  - No data model or validation duplication
  - Simple session-based authentication
  - Faster development and debugging
  - Sufficient UX for form-heavy accounting workflows

- **Java 25 + Spring Boot over Node.js:**
  - BigDecimal for precise financial calculations
  - Type safety for complex business logic
  - Mature transaction management (ACID)
  - Virtual threads for efficient resource utilization (especially when co-locating instances)
  - Large Java talent pool in Indonesia
  - Battle-tested security for financial applications

- **HTMX Enhancement:**
  - Modern UX without SPA complexity
  - Partial page updates
  - Progressive enhancement
  - No build process required

- **Document Storage Strategy:**
  - Phase 1: MinIO (self-hosted, cost-optimized)
  - Phase 2+: Indonesian cloud or AWS/GCP
  - S3-compatible API for easy migration

- **DevSecOps Tools:**
  - Docker Compose (local development)
  - Ansible (IaC, deployment)
  - Playwright (functional testing)
  - K6 (performance testing)
  - SonarQube, OWASP tools, Trivy (security)

**Implementation:** See [Technology Stack Documentation](05-technology-stack.md) for details

**Trade-offs:**
- Less flashy UI than SPA (acceptable for target users)
- Server-rendered pages (suitable for form-heavy workflows)
- MinIO requires ops overhead (offset by cost savings)
- Can refactor to API architecture later if mobile app needed

**Review Date:** After MVP launch
