## Patch Release 2025.12.1

Bug fixes and improvements for the first GA release.

### Fixed

- **Template Favorites**: Removed deprecated template-level `isFavorite` field from `JournalTemplate` entity
  - Favorites are now fully user-specific via `UserTemplatePreference` table
  - Updated database migration V003 to remove `is_favorite` column from `journal_templates` table
  - Fixed data export/import to match new schema (10 fields instead of 11)
  - Updated test data migrations and Artivisi client seed data

- **Transaction List**: Fixed edit button that was unresponsive
  - Removed `preventDefault()` from onclick handler (kept `stopPropagation()`)

### Changed

- Removed deprecated API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/favorites` - use user template preferences instead
  - `POST /api/{id}/toggle-favorite` - use user template preferences instead

### Migration Notes

This release includes a breaking database schema change:
- The `is_favorite` column has been removed from `journal_templates` table
- Existing favorite markers at template level will be lost
- Users should re-mark their favorite templates, which will be stored per-user in `user_template_preferences`

If you have existing data exports, they need to be regenerated as the CSV format has changed.

### Technical Details

- Database migration V003 updated (existing databases will need migration)
- Test data migrations V902 and V903 updated
- Client seed data format updated
