# Release 2026.03-RELEASE

## Highlights

- **AI Metadata UI**: Template metadata (semantic description, keywords, merchants, amount range, patterns) now editable via web UI
- **User Manual Generator Fix**: Resolved recurring duplicate section rendering bug
- **Shareable Manual Links**: User manual sections now have shareable anchor URLs

## What's New

### AI Metadata Management UI
- Collapsible "Metadata AI" section in template create/edit form
- Metadata card on template detail page (keywords as green badges, merchants as blue badges, patterns as monospace badges, amount range formatted)
- Fields: semantic description, keywords, example merchants, typical amount range (min/max), merchant patterns
- Metadata persists through template versioning (both updateInPlace and createNewVersion)
- 3 Playwright functional tests with auto-generated screenshots for user manual

### User Manual Improvements
- Shareable anchor links: sidebar clicks update URL hash, loading URL with hash auto-scrolls to section
- User manual creation guidelines document (`docs/user-manual-creation-guidelines.md`)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed duplicate section rendering in user manual generator: `extractSectionContent()` returned entire file when section title matched H1 heading, causing H2 sections with their own entries to render twice. Fixed by excluding sibling sections during content aggregation.
- Fixed template edit redirect after versioning: controller redirected to old template ID instead of new version ID when `createNewVersion()` was triggered

## Documentation

- Updated user manual: AI metadata UI instructions, screenshots, FAQ, troubleshooting
- Updated operations guide to match production setup
- Added `docs/user-manual-creation-guidelines.md` with section extraction rules and duplicate prevention guidelines
- Added reference in CLAUDE.md key files table
