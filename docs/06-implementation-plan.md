  - Created DataMaskingUtil.java with maskNik, maskNpwp, maskPhone, maskBankAccount, maskBpjs, maskEmail
  - Created ThymeleafConfig.java with custom #mask dialect for templates
  - Applied masking in employees/detail.html and users/detail.html
- [x] ~~Add @SecureField annotation for role-based field visibility~~ - Won't implement: Thymeleaf sec:authorize already provides role-based field visibility in templates
- [x] ~~Mask sensitive fields in API responses~~ - Won't implement: No REST API - MVC app uses Thymeleaf templates with sec:authorize and #mask dialect

**Backup Security:**
- [x] Encrypt backup exports - Handled by Ansible infrastructure (GPG + AES256 for B2/GDrive)
- [x] Implement backup file integrity verification (SHA-256 checksum) - backup.sh/restore.sh
- [x] Add confirmation dialog for destructive operations (data import truncate) - import/index.html onclick confirm

**Data in Use (Memory Protection):**
- [x] Disable heap dumps in production (`-XX:+DisableAttachMechanism`) - systemd service

  - [x] Retention status check - DataSubjectService.getRetentionStatus() (10-year retention per UU KUP Art. 28)
  - N/A ~~Automated purge job~~ — 10-year tax retention means no data expires in foreseeable future
  - N/A ~~Pre-deletion notification~~
- N/A ~~Records of Processing Activities (ROPA)~~ — minimal PII scope, not a high-volume data processor

---

## Phase 7: API Foundation ✅

**Goal:** Expose REST API for external integrations, mobile apps, and domain-specific applications

**Note:** Most API infrastructure was built organically during Phases 6/9/Analysis. This phase tracks what was already done and the remaining items.

### 7.1 API Core ✅

**Authentication (OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization, RFC 8628):**
- [x] DeviceCode entity (user_code, device_code, 15-min expiry, status workflow)
- [x] DeviceToken entity (hashed token, scopes, 30-day expiry, revocation support)
- [x] DeviceAuthService (generate codes, validate tokens, revoke)
- [x] BearerTokenAuthenticationFilter (Bearer token validation, scope extraction)
- [x] DeviceAuthApiController (`POST /api/device/code`, `POST /api/device/token`)
- [x] DeviceAuthorizationController (browser-based user authorization page)

**API Controllers:**
- [x] DraftTransactionApiController (`/api/drafts`) — from-receipt, from-text, approve, reject
- [x] TransactionApiController (`/api/transactions`) — create, post, bulk-post
- [x] TemplateApiController (`/api/templates`) — CRUD
- [x] FinancialAnalysisApiController (`/api/analysis`) — reports, snapshots, trial-balance, balance-sheet, income-statement, cash-flow, tax-summary, receivables, payables, accounts, drafts, transactions (paginated)
- [x] BankReconciliationApiController (`/api/bank-reconciliation`) — full recon workflow
- [x] DataImportApiController (`/api/data-import`) — bulk ZIP import

**Infrastructure:**
- [x] ApiExceptionHandler — structured JSON error responses (error code, message, timestamp, fieldErrors)
- [x] SecurityAuditService — API call audit logging (async)
- [x] 7 OAuth scopes: `drafts:create`, `drafts:approve`, `drafts:read`, `analysis:read`, `analysis:write`, `transactions:post`, `data:import`
- [x] `@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_...')")` on all API endpoints
- [x] Static API capabilities descriptor (`/api/capabilities.json`)
- N/A ~~Idempotency key on Transaction~~ — low ROI, extensive schema/logic changes for unlikely duplicate scenario
- N/A ~~Separate ApiKey entity~~ — DeviceToken already serves this purpose with scopes and revocation
- N/A ~~Separate AccountApiController~~ — accounts exposed via `/api/analysis/accounts` and `/api/drafts/accounts`
- N/A ~~Separate ReportApiController~~ — reports exposed via `/api/analysis/*` (trial-balance, balance-sheet, income-statement, cash-flow, tax-summary)
- N/A ~~OpenAPI/Swagger~~ — `/api/capabilities.json` provides machine-readable API discovery for AI consumers
- N/A ~~Per-key rate limiting~~ — global `RateLimitFilter` already covers all endpoints; per-key throttling unnecessary for single-company app
- N/A ~~API versioning~~ — premature for single-deployment app; can add later if needed

### 7.2 API Pagination ✅
- [x] `GET /api/analysis/transactions` — paginated (page, size params, returns Page<T>)
- [x] `GET /api/analysis/reports` — paginated (page, size params, default 0/20)

- [x] Revoke all tokens for current user
- [x] Token usage info (last_used_at, last_used_ip)
- [x] Sidebar link (Perangkat API) in Master Data group
- [x] 5 Playwright functional tests

**Phase 7 Deliverable:** REST API with OAuth 2.0 device auth, 7 API controllers, structured error handling, and device token management UI.

  - [x] Fuzzy match (±1 day, same amount)
  - [x] Description keyword matching
- [x] Manual matching UI (drag-and-drop or checkbox)
- [x] Create missing transactions from unmatched statement items
- [x] Mark as "bank only" or "book only" for discrepancies

### 8.3 Reconciliation Reports
- [x] Reconciliation summary (matched, unmatched, discrepancies)
- [x] Bank reconciliation statement (book balance → bank balance)
- [x] Outstanding items list
- [x] PDF/Excel export

**Value analysis (manual reconciliation time per month):**

- 50-100 transactions: 15-30 min (manageable)
- 200-300 transactions: 1-2 hours (tedious, automation helpful)
- 500+ transactions: 3+ hours (automation essential)

**Phase 8 Deliverable:** Bank statement import, auto-matching, manual matching UI, and reconciliation reports.

## Phase 10: Invoice & Bill Management ✅

**Goal:** Standalone invoice/bill cycle with line items, payment tracking, and aging reports

**Note:** The existing Invoice entity is project-milestone-bound. This phase adds a general-purpose invoice/bill system usable by all industries, and extends aging/statement reports on top of it.

- [ ] Invoice CRUD UI (create from scratch or from transaction)
- [ ] Invoice PDF generation (printable, sendable to client)
- [ ] Invoice status workflow: DRAFT → SENT → PARTIAL → PAID / OVERDUE / CANCELLED
- [ ] Mark as sent (records sent_at)
- [ ] Functional tests
- [ ] User manual

### 10.2 Vendor Bill (Faktur Pembelian)
- [ ] Bill entity (vendor/supplier, bill_number, bill_date, due_date, amount, status)
- [ ] BillLine entity (description, quantity, unit_price, tax, amount)
- [ ] Vendor entity (dedicated table — separate from Client, different data needs: default expense account, tax withholding)
- [ ] Bill CRUD UI
- [ ] Bill status workflow: DRAFT → APPROVED → PARTIAL → PAID / OVERDUE / CANCELLED
- [ ] Link bill to purchase transaction
- [ ] Functional tests
- [ ] User manual

### 10.3 Vendor Bill API
- [ ] `POST /api/bills` — create bill from AI-parsed data (vendor, lines, dates, amounts)
- [ ] `POST /api/bills/{id}/approve` — approve and post journal entry
- [ ] `GET /api/bills` — list bills (paginated, filterable by status/vendor/date)
- [ ] `GET /api/bills/{id}` — bill detail
- [ ] OAuth scope: `bills:create`, `bills:approve`, `bills:read`
- [ ] Input: structured JSON (vendor name, bill number, date, due date, line items with description/quantity/unit_price/tax)
- [ ] Vendor matching: match by name against existing vendors, create new if not found
- [ ] Account mapping: use configurable default expense accounts per vendor or category
- [ ] Functional tests

### 10.4 Payment Tracking
- [ ] Record payment against specific invoice (full or partial)
- [ ] Record payment against specific bill (full or partial)
- [ ] Auto-create receipt/payment journal entry on payment recording
- [ ] Payment history per invoice/bill
- [ ] Outstanding balance calculation (invoice amount - sum of payments)
- [ ] Auto-update status (PARTIAL when partially paid, PAID when fully paid)
- [ ] Functional tests

### 10.5 Aging Reports
- [ ] Receivables aging report (current, 30d, 60d, 90d, >90d buckets) based on invoice due dates
- [ ] Payables aging report (same buckets) based on bill due dates
- [ ] Aging by client/vendor
- [ ] As-of date selection
- [ ] PDF/Excel export

- [ ] User manual

### 10.6 Customer/Vendor Statements
- [ ] Per-client statement (outstanding invoices, payments received, balance)
- [ ] Per-vendor statement (outstanding bills, payments made, balance)
- [ ] Date range filter
- [ ] Printable PDF (suitable for sending to client as payment reminder)
- [ ] Functional tests
- [ ] User manual

### 11.1 Recurring Schedule
- [ ] RecurringTransaction entity (template, frequency, start/end date, next_run, status)
- [ ] Frequency options: daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly
- [ ] Recurring transaction CRUD UI
- [ ] Preview next N occurrences
- [ ] Pause/resume schedule

### 11.2 Auto-Posting
- [ ] Scheduler job (daily, creates and posts transactions on due date)
- [ ] Skip weekends/holidays option
- [ ] Notification on auto-post (dashboard widget)
- [ ] Error handling (log failures, retry next day)

## Future Enhancements (As Needed)

Items below are not planned phases. They are implemented only when a concrete client need arises.

### Infrastructure
- [ ] S3-compatible document storage backend
- [ ] ClamAV virus scanning for uploads
- [ ] Multi-currency support
- [ ] Materialized account balances (only if report queries exceed 2s — current performance analysis shows this is decades away for typical usage)

### Custom Projects (Per Client Request)
- [ ] PJAP integration (e-Faktur, e-Bupot)
- [ ] Digital signature (PSrE)
- [ ] E-Meterai integration
- [ ] Payment gateway integration

## Database Migration Strategy

### Rules
1. **Always add, never remove** - Mark columns as deprecated, don't delete
2. **Nullable first** - New columns must be nullable or have defaults
3. **Backfill separately** - Data migration in separate step from schema change
4. **Test rollback** - Every migration must have tested rollback script

### Migration Files
- V001: Security schema (users)
- V002: Security data (admin user)
- V003: App schema (COA, journal entries, templates, transactions, etc.)
- V004: App seed data
- V901-V907: Test data migrations

---

## Testing Strategy

### Per Phase
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for database operations
- Functional tests (Playwright) for critical paths
- Migration tests on sample data

### Critical Paths to Test
1. Transaction creation and posting
2. Journal entry balance validation
3. Report generation
4. User authentication
5. Period locking enforcement
