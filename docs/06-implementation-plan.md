  - Created DataMaskingUtil.java with maskNik, maskNpwp, maskPhone, maskBankAccount, maskBpjs, maskEmail
  - Created ThymeleafConfig.java with custom #mask dialect for templates
  - Applied masking in employees/detail.html and users/detail.html
- [x] ~~Add @SecureField annotation for role-based field visibility~~ - Won't implement: Thymeleaf sec:authorize already provides role-based field visibility in templates
- [x] ~~Mask sensitive fields in API responses~~ - Won't implement: No REST API - MVC app uses Thymeleaf templates with sec:authorize and #mask dialect

**Backup Security:**

  - [x] Retention status check - DataSubjectService.getRetentionStatus() (10-year retention per UU KUP Art. 28)
  - N/A ~~Automated purge job~~ — 10-year tax retention means no data expires in foreseeable future
  - N/A ~~Pre-deletion notification~~
- N/A ~~Records of Processing Activities (ROPA)~~ — minimal PII scope, not a high-volume data processor

---

## Phase 7: API Foundation ✅

**Goal:** Expose REST API for external integrations, mobile apps, and domain-specific applications

**Note:** Most API infrastructure was built organically during Phases 6/9/Analysis. This phase tracks what was already done and the remaining items.

### 7.1 API Core ✅

**Authentication (OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization, RFC 8628):**
- [x] DeviceCode entity (user_code, device_code, 15-min expiry, status workflow)
- [x] DeviceToken entity (hashed token, scopes, 30-day expiry, revocation support)
- [x] DeviceAuthService (generate codes, validate tokens, revoke)
- [x] BearerTokenAuthenticationFilter (Bearer token validation, scope extraction)
- [x] DeviceAuthApiController (`POST /api/device/code`, `POST /api/device/token`)
- [x] DeviceAuthorizationController (browser-based user authorization page)

**API Controllers:**
- [x] DraftTransactionApiController (`/api/drafts`) — from-receipt, from-text, approve, reject
- [x] TransactionApiController (`/api/transactions`) — create, post, bulk-post
- [x] TemplateApiController (`/api/templates`) — CRUD
- [x] FinancialAnalysisApiController (`/api/analysis`) — reports, snapshots, trial-balance, balance-sheet, income-statement, cash-flow, tax-summary, receivables, payables, accounts, drafts, transactions (paginated)
- [x] BankReconciliationApiController (`/api/bank-reconciliation`) — full recon workflow
- [x] DataImportApiController (`/api/data-import`) — bulk ZIP import

**Infrastructure:**
- [x] ApiExceptionHandler — structured JSON error responses (error code, message, timestamp, fieldErrors)
- [x] SecurityAuditService — API call audit logging (async)
- [x] 7 OAuth scopes: `drafts:create`, `drafts:approve`, `drafts:read`, `analysis:read`, `analysis:write`, `transactions:post`, `data:import`
- [x] `@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_...')")` on all API endpoints
- [x] Static API capabilities descriptor (`/api/capabilities.json`)
- N/A ~~Idempotency key on Transaction~~ — low ROI, extensive schema/logic changes for unlikely duplicate scenario
- N/A ~~Separate ApiKey entity~~ — DeviceToken already serves this purpose with scopes and revocation
- N/A ~~Separate AccountApiController~~ — accounts exposed via `/api/analysis/accounts` and `/api/drafts/accounts`
- N/A ~~Separate ReportApiController~~ — reports exposed via `/api/analysis/*` (trial-balance, balance-sheet, income-statement, cash-flow, tax-summary)
- N/A ~~OpenAPI/Swagger~~ — `/api/capabilities.json` provides machine-readable API discovery for AI consumers
- N/A ~~Per-key rate limiting~~ — global `RateLimitFilter` already covers all endpoints; per-key throttling unnecessary for single-company app
- N/A ~~API versioning~~ — premature for single-deployment app; can add later if needed

### 7.2 API Pagination ✅
- [x] `GET /api/analysis/transactions` — paginated (page, size params, returns Page<T>)
- [x] `GET /api/analysis/reports` — paginated (page, size params, default 0/20)
- [x] `GET /api/analysis/drafts` — paginated (page, size params, default 0/20)

### 7.3 Device Token Management UI ✅

- [x] Revoke device token (with confirmation)
- [x] Revoke all tokens for current user
- [x] Token usage info (last_used_at, last_used_ip)
- [x] Sidebar link (Perangkat API) in Master Data group
- [x] 5 Playwright functional tests

**Phase 7 Deliverable:** REST API with OAuth 2.0 device auth, 7 API controllers, structured error handling, and device token management UI.

- [ ] Preload configs (BCA, BNI, Mandiri, BSI, CIMB)
- [ ] Admin UI for parser config
- [ ] CSV/Excel upload and parsing
- [ ] Statement item entity (date, description, amount, balance)

### 9.2 Transaction Matching
- [ ] Bank reconciliation entity (period, status, bank account)
- [ ] Auto-matching rules:
  - [ ] Exact match (date + amount)
  - [ ] Fuzzy match (±1 day, same amount)
  - [ ] Description keyword matching
- [ ] Manual matching UI (drag-and-drop or checkbox)
- [ ] Create missing transactions from unmatched statement items
- [ ] Mark as "bank only" or "book only" for discrepancies

### 9.3 Reconciliation Reports
- [ ] Reconciliation summary (matched, unmatched, discrepancies)
- [ ] Bank reconciliation statement (book balance → bank balance)
- [ ] Outstanding items list
- [ ] PDF/Excel export

**Value analysis (manual reconciliation time per month):**
- 20-30 transactions: 5-10 min (easy, no automation needed)
- 50-100 transactions: 15-30 min (manageable)
- 200-300 transactions: 1-2 hours (tedious, automation helpful)

- N/A ~~Revenue trend chart (12 months)~~ — covered by AI analysis via `/api/analysis/snapshot` and published reports
- N/A ~~Expense trend by category (12 months)~~ — covered by AI analysis via `/api/analysis/income-statement`
- N/A ~~Profit margin trend (12 months)~~ — covered by AI analysis (KPI metrics with period-over-period change)
- N/A ~~Cash flow trend (12 months)~~ — covered by AI analysis via `/api/analysis/cash-flow`
- N/A ~~Comparison: current period vs previous period~~ — AI snapshot already includes `*Change` fields
- N/A ~~Comparison: current period vs same period last year~~ — AI can compute from existing endpoints
- N/A ~~Chart library integration (Chart.js or similar)~~ — static charts low ROI vs AI-generated contextual analysis

### 10.2 Smart Alerts
- [ ] Alert entity (type, threshold, enabled, last_triggered)
- [ ] Alert types:
  - [ ] Cash low warning
  - [ ] Overdue receivables
  - [ ] Expense spike (vs average)
  - [ ] Project cost overrun
  - [ ] Project margin drop
  - [ ] Payment collection slowdown
  - [ ] Client concentration risk
- [ ] Alert threshold settings per type
- [ ] Enable/disable individual alerts
- [ ] Dashboard notification display
- [ ] Email notification (optional)
- [ ] Alert history and acknowledgment

### 10.3 Transaction Tags
- [ ] Tag type entity (user-defined: "Channel", "Campaign", "Category")
- [ ] Tag entity (values per type)
- [ ] Tag type CRUD UI
- [ ] Tag CRUD UI
- [ ] Multi-tag per transaction (journal entry)
- [ ] Tag filters in transaction list
- [ ] Tag-based reports (summary by tag)

**Phase 10 Deliverable:** Trend charts, configurable alerts, and flexible transaction tagging.

## Phase 11+: Future Enhancements

### Budget Management
- [ ] Budget entity (account, period, amount)
- [ ] Budget per account per period
- [ ] Budget CRUD UI
- [ ] Copy from previous period
- [ ] Budget vs Actual report
- [ ] Variance analysis
- [ ] Over-budget highlighting
- [ ] PDF/Excel export

### Industry Seed Packs ✅
- [x] IT Services seed pack (75 COA, 37 templates, 17 salary components)
- [x] Online Seller seed pack (80 COA, marketplace-specific accounts)
- [x] Manufacturing seed pack (Coffee Shop - 90 COA, 33 templates, BOM products)
- [x] Education seed pack (Campus - 87 COA, 31 templates, student billing)
- [x] Functional tests for all 4 industries (115 total tests)
- [x] User manuals for all 4 industries

### Additional Industry Templates (Future)
- [ ] Photography COA and journal templates
- [ ] General Freelancer COA and journal templates

### Account Balances (Materialized) - Performance Optimization

**Not implemented.** The system uses real-time calculation by querying journal_entries directly.

**Why not materialized?**
- Current approach: Sum debit/credit from journal_entries for each report
- PostgreSQL performance with indexes is excellent for typical transaction volumes
- Materialization adds complexity: triggers, recalculation logic, cascade updates
- Trade-off: Simple architecture vs. marginal performance gain

**Performance analysis (PostgreSQL with proper indexes):**
- 10,000 journal lines: <50ms (5 years @ 80 tx/month)
- 50,000 journal lines: ~100ms (5 years @ 400 tx/month)
- 100,000 journal lines: ~200ms (5 years @ 800 tx/month)
- 500,000 journal lines: ~500ms (5 years @ 4,000 tx/month)

**For typical small IT services (100 tx/month):** Would take 40+ years to reach 100,000 lines.

**When to reconsider:** Only if report generation consistently exceeds 2 seconds and users report slowness (>500 transactions/month sustained for several years).

**Implementation approach if needed:**
- [ ] Create account_balances table with monthly snapshots
- [ ] Trigger balance update on journal entry post/void
- [ ] Background job for period-based aggregation
- [ ] Balance recalculation utility for data fixes
- [ ] Modify ReportService to query materialized balances instead of journal_entries

### Document Management Enhancements
- [ ] S3-compatible storage backend
- [ ] Image compression on upload
- [ ] PDF optimization
- [ ] ClamAV virus scanning
- [ ] Bulk upload
- [ ] Document access logging

### Advanced Features (As Needed)
- [ ] Multi-currency support
- [ ] API for mobile app
- [ ] Custom report builder
- [ ] Dashboard analytics
- [ ] Automated backups
- [ ] Admin: view soft-deleted records

### Custom Projects (Per Client Request)
- [ ] PJAP integration (e-Faktur, e-Bupot)
- [ ] Digital signature (PSrE)
- [ ] E-Meterai integration
- [ ] Payment gateway integration

## Database Migration Strategy

### Rules
1. **Always add, never remove** - Mark columns as deprecated, don't delete
2. **Nullable first** - New columns must be nullable or have defaults
3. **Backfill separately** - Data migration in separate step from schema change
4. **Test rollback** - Every migration must have tested rollback script

### Migration Files
- V001: Security schema (users)
- V002: Security data (admin user)
- V003: App schema (COA, journal entries, templates, transactions, etc.)
- V004: App seed data
- V901-V907: Test data migrations

---

## Testing Strategy

### Per Phase
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for database operations
- Functional tests (Playwright) for critical paths
- Migration tests on sample data

### Critical Paths to Test
1. Transaction creation and posting
2. Journal entry balance validation
3. Report generation
4. User authentication
5. Period locking enforcement
