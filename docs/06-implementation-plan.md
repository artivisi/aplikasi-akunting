# Implementation Plan

## Guiding Principles

1. **Go Live Fast** - MVP with core features only, add incrementally
2. **No Breaking Changes** - Database migrations must be backward compatible
3. **Feature Flags** - New features behind toggles until stable
4. **Data Safety** - Production data must never be corrupted or lost

**Implementation complexity comparison (why additive, not role switching):**

| Aspect | Additive | Role Switching |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Security config | Standard Spring Security | Custom service |
| Session state | None | Track active role |
| UI components | None extra | Role switcher dropdown |
| After switch | N/A | Refresh/redirect needed |
| Lines of code | ~50 | ~150-200 |

Additive is ~3x simpler. Role switching only needed for strict audit trails or compliance requirements.

### 3.9 Full Data Export/Import ⏳

**Goal:** Complete data portability for semi-production workflow (export → reset DB → import).

**Current gap:** DataExportService only exports 11 of 34 entities. Missing: JournalTemplate, CompanyConfig, SalaryComponent, EmployeeSalaryComponent, FiscalPeriod, TaxDeadline, CompanyBankAccount, MerchantMapping, User/UserRole, and 12 others.

#### Export Format
- **Container:** ZIP archive
- **Content:** CSV files with numbered prefix for import order
- **Encoding:** UTF-8, RFC 4180 CSV escaping
- **References:** Natural keys (codes, not UUIDs)

#### Import Order (filename prefix determines sequence)
```
01_company_config.csv
02_chart_of_accounts.csv
03_salary_components.csv
04_journal_templates.csv
05_journal_template_lines.csv
06_journal_template_tags.csv
07_clients.csv
08_projects.csv
09_project_milestones.csv
10_project_payment_terms.csv
11_fiscal_periods.csv

31_telegram_user_links.csv
32_audit_logs.csv
33_transaction_sequences.csv
documents/
  index.csv
  {files...}
MANIFEST.md
```

#### Import Behavior: Full Replace
Import **clears all existing data** and replaces 100% with exported file content:
1. Truncate all tables (reverse dependency order)
2. Load CSVs in filename order
3. No merge with existing data

#### Import Strategy: Map Pre-load
Pre-load reference entities into Maps before processing dependent CSVs to avoid N+1 queries:

```java
Map<String, ChartOfAccount> accountMap;      // for journal entries, template lines
Map<String, Client> clientMap;               // for projects, invoices
Map<String, Project> projectMap;             // for transactions, invoices
Map<String, JournalTemplate> templateMap;    // for transactions
Map<String, Employee> employeeMap;           // for payroll details
Map<String, SalaryComponent> componentMap;   // for employee salary components
```

Estimated import duration (moderate dataset): ~3-5 seconds.

#### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Enhance DataExportService: add all 34 entities with numbered CSV filenames
- [ ] Create DataImportService: parse CSVs in filename order, create entities
- [ ] Pre-load reference entities into Maps before processing dependent CSVs
- [ ] Handle passwords (import bcrypt hashes as-is)
- [ ] Resolve references via natural keys (new UUIDs generated on import)
- [ ] Import controller and UI (`/settings/import`)
- [ ] Validation preview before import
- [ ] Functional test: full round-trip verification
  1. Start from seed migration (base COA, templates, admin user)
  2. Modify seed data (edit COA names, update template lines)
  3. Add custom data (new accounts, new templates, company config)
  4. Create transactions (income, expense, with journal entries)
  5. Add payroll data (employee, payroll run)
  6. Export all data
  7. Import exported data (truncates all tables, replaces with export)
  8. Verify: modified seed data reflects edits
  9. Verify: custom accounts and templates present
  10. Verify: transactions and journal entries intact
  11. Verify: payroll data restored

**Phase 3 Deliverable:** ✅ Complete payroll system with tax compliance, role-based access control, and employee self-service.

- 50-100 transactions: 15-30 min (manageable)
- 200-300 transactions: 1-2 hours (tedious, automation helpful)
- 500+ transactions: 3+ hours (automation essential)

**For typical small IT services (30-80 tx/month):** Manual reconciliation takes ~15 min/month.
Bank reconciliation feature becomes valuable at ~150+ transactions/month or with multiple bank accounts.

**Phase 4 Deliverable:** Transaction tagging, trend analysis, smart alerts, and bank reconciliation.

---

## Phase 5: Assets & Budget

**Goal:** Fixed asset tracking and budget management

**Implementation note:** Follow payroll pattern for journal posting:

- Use extended FormulaContext with domain-specific variables (e.g., `assetCost`, `accumulatedDepreciation`, `disposalProceeds`, `gainLoss`)
- Create system templates for: asset purchase, depreciation entry, asset disposal
- Keep asset-specific logic in AssetService, core accounting remains generic

- [ ] Fee expense auto-creation
- [ ] Marketplace reconciliation report

### Account Balances (Materialized) - Performance Optimization

**Not implemented.** The system uses real-time calculation by querying journal_entries directly.

**Why not materialized?**
- Current approach: Sum debit/credit from journal_entries for each report
- PostgreSQL performance with indexes is excellent for typical transaction volumes
- Materialization adds complexity: triggers, recalculation logic, cascade updates
- Trade-off: Simple architecture vs. marginal performance gain

**Performance analysis (PostgreSQL with proper indexes):**
- 10,000 journal lines: <50ms (5 years @ 80 tx/month)
- 50,000 journal lines: ~100ms (5 years @ 400 tx/month)
- 100,000 journal lines: ~200ms (5 years @ 800 tx/month)
- 500,000 journal lines: ~500ms (5 years @ 4,000 tx/month)

**For typical small IT services (100 tx/month):** Would take 40+ years to reach 100,000 lines.

**When to reconsider:** Only if report generation consistently exceeds 2 seconds and users report slowness (>500 transactions/month sustained for several years).

**Implementation approach if needed:**
- [ ] Create account_balances table with monthly snapshots
- [ ] Trigger balance update on journal entry post/void
- [ ] Background job for period-based aggregation
- [ ] Balance recalculation utility for data fixes
- [ ] Modify ReportService to query materialized balances instead of journal_entries

### Document Management Enhancements
- [ ] S3-compatible storage backend
- [ ] Image compression on upload
- [ ] PDF optimization
- [ ] ClamAV virus scanning
- [ ] Bulk upload
- [ ] Document access logging

- [ ] Automated backups
- [ ] Admin: view soft-deleted records

### Custom Projects (Per Client Request)
- [ ] PJAP integration (e-Faktur, e-Bupot)
- [ ] Digital signature (PSrE)
- [ ] E-Meterai integration
- [ ] Payment gateway integration

## Database Migration Strategy

### Rules
1. **Always add, never remove** - Mark columns as deprecated, don't delete
2. **Nullable first** - New columns must be nullable or have defaults
3. **Backfill separately** - Data migration in separate step from schema change
4. **Test rollback** - Every migration must have tested rollback script

### Migration Files
- V001: Security schema (users)
- V002: Security data (admin user)
- V003: App schema (COA, journal entries, templates, transactions, etc.)
- V004: App seed data
- V901-V907: Test data migrations

---

## Testing Strategy

### Per Phase
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for database operations
- Functional tests (Playwright) for critical paths
- Migration tests on sample data

### Critical Paths to Test
1. Transaction creation and posting
2. Journal entry balance validation
3. Report generation
4. User authentication
5. Period locking enforcement
