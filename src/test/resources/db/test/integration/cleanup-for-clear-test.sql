-- Templates and accounts are cleared by the service's clearAllData() method

DELETE FROM documents;

-- Delete invoices (FK reference to transactions via id_transaction)
DELETE FROM invoices;

-- Delete payroll runs (FK reference to transactions via id_transaction)
DELETE FROM payroll_runs;

-- Delete all journal entries
DELETE FROM journal_entries;
